# showcase

The Showcase module is a reusable widget with tabs to showcase your widget, display README, share codes and license. It is the first module (together with source code view, it's dependent module) to adopt Flutter built-in modules capability as described in [Flutter Multi-modules Support](http://limcheekin.blogspot.com/2021/03/flutter-multi-modules-support.html). 

A picture is worth a thousand words:-

If you are interested to reuse the source code of the screen, please check out the `showcase` branch of the git repository hosted at https://github.com/limcheekin/flutter-widgets-explorer. Feel free to fork the repository and send me pull request.

I'd love to hear from you. :)
