# source-code-view

The Source Code View is a reusable widget to share code of public Github repository such as [flutter-widgets-explorer](https://github.com/limcheekin/flutter-widgets-explorer). It is the outcome of knowledge gained in the previous showcases such as Syntax View, Animate Icons, URL Launcher, Markdown View, and Shimmer Effect. 

Thanks to [pubspec_parse](https://pub.dev/packages/pubspec_parse) package allowed the `PubspecDependenciesView` widget to retrieve dependencies data from the `pubspec.yaml` file.

If you are interested to reuse the source code of the screen, please check out the `source_code_view` branch of the git repository hosted at https://github.com/limcheekin/flutter-widgets-explorer. Feel free to fork the repository and send me pull request.

I'd love to hear from you. :)
